ShellHacks 2025 Break Through Tech Challenge Submission

Challenge:

**Computing Everyone:**

FIU's Knight Foundation School of Computing & Information Sciences is one of the top schools for computing, and it is a highly inclusive and welcoming place for students of all abilities. Yet, a mere 24% of students at the school are those who identify as women. We need HELP to figure out how we can tell our school's story better! Here's our challenge: build a project involving AI to help make the school and major more appealing and welcoming to students who identify as women!

**Our Submission:**

We believe adding a chatbot that can answer an interested user's questions will be beneficial in bringing more people into tech. The chatbot will be able to take the user's background information and match them to KFSCIS programs that they are eligible for. The chatbot will also share current stats regarding the current student population, and will encourage the user to join a program to improve said stats.
